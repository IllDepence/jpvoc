=====
This is just a small vocabulary exercise web app I wrote to work on my Japanese vocab.

Features
--------
* Add words in kana and your native language, optionally add the word in kanji and further information
* Three different modes (japanese to native, native to japanese, mixed)
* Words at which you perfom good get asked less frequently than those you still have problems with
* Dis/enable or delete words
* View the stats page to see at which words you performed best and what words still are problematic
